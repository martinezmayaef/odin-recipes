        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Tortilla: Use store-bought or homemade soft flour tortillas.</li>
                <li>Oil: Brush the tortillas with olive oil before you season them.</li>
                <li>Seasonings: These tortilla pizzas are seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper, and dried oregano.</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce: Use store-bought or homemade tomato sauce.</li>
                <li>Toppings: Top the tortilla pizzas with sliced chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions. Of course, you can customize the toppings to suit your taste.</li>
                <li>Cheese: Finish the pizzas with mozzarella cheese. </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place tortilla on a baking sheet. Brush with olive oil; sprinkle garlic powder, salt, and pepper on top.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread tomato sauce on top; arrange chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions over tomato sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle oregano over cheese. Slice pizza into wedges using a pizza cutter.</li>
            </ol>
