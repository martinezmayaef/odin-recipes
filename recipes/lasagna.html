            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Start by gathering your ingredients: lasagna noodles, marinara sauce, ground meat (usually beef or pork), ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese (shredded), Parmesan cheese (grated), onions, garlic, and spices like oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
                <p><strong>Cooking the Sauce</strong>: In a large skillet or saucepan, sauté diced onions and minced garlic until they are soft and fragrant. Add the ground meat and cook until it's browned and cooked through. Drain excess fat if needed. Stir in the marinara sauce and season with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil to taste. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>
                <p><strong>Assembling the Lasagna</strong>: Begin assembling the lasagna by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers—sauce, noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan—until you have used up all your ingredients, ending with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</p>
                <p><strong>Baking</strong>: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly so it does not touch the cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</p>
                <p><strong>Resting and Serving</strong>: Once out of the oven, let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions. Serve your homemade lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a complete meal that will delight your family and friends.</p>
