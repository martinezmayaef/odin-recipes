            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Lasagna, a beloved Italian classic, is a dish that embodies comfort and flavor in every layer. At its heart are sheets of tender, wide lasagna noodles, carefully layered with a rich and savory tomato-based marinara sauce. Each layer is generously adorned with a creamy mixture of ricotta cheese, lending a smooth and indulgent texture that complements the hearty elements of the dish.</p>
                <p>The essence of lasagna lies in its construction: each stratum intricately woven together to form a symphony of flavors. Alongside the sauce and cheese, seasoned ground meat—typically beef or pork—adds a robust depth, its savory essence infusing into the surrounding layers. Sprinkles of grated Parmesan cheese atop each stratum melt into a golden crust during baking, offering a tantalizing contrast of texture and a nutty richness that enhances every bite.</p>
                <p>Baked to perfection, lasagna emerges from the oven with bubbling mozzarella cheese cascading over its edges, a sight and aroma that evoke warmth and anticipation. As the dish rests, its layers meld together, allowing the flavors to intensify and harmonize. Served steaming hot, each slice of lasagna promises a comforting embrace—a melding of pasta, sauce, and cheese that satisfies both the palate and the soul, making it a timeless favorite for gatherings and family dinners alike.</p>

                    <li>Marinara sauce (homemade or store-bought, about 4 cups)</li>
                    <li>Ground meat (beef, pork, or a mixture, about 1 pound)</li>
                    <li>Ricotta cheese (about 2 cups)</li>
                    <li>Mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 2 cups)
                    <li>Parmesan cheese, grated (about 1 cup)</li>
                    <li>Onion, finely diced (1 medium)</li>
                    <li>Garlic, minced (3-4 cloves)</li>
                    <li>Dried oregano (1 teaspoon)</li>
                    <li>Dried basil (1 teaspoon)</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preparation</strong>: Start by gathering your ingredients: lasagna noodles, marinara sauce, ground meat (usually beef or pork), ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese (shredded), Parmesan cheese (grated), onions, garlic, and spices like oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Cooking the Sauce</strong>: In a large skillet or saucepan, sauté diced onions and minced garlic until they are soft and fragrant. Add the ground meat and cook until it's browned and cooked through. Drain excess fat if needed. Stir in the marinara sauce and season with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil to taste. Let the sauce simmer for about 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Assembling the Lasagna</strong>: Begin assembling the lasagna by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers—sauce, noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan—until you have used up all your ingredients, ending with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Baking</strong>: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly so it does not touch the cheese. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Resting and Serving</strong>: Once out of the oven, let the lasagna rest for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions. Serve your homemade lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a complete meal that will delight your family and friends.</li>
